Hi, I'm Dennis, a Tokyo-based programmer. 

I'm satisfied most when working on projects that scratch my creative itch and enhance my other interests, including snowboarding, video games, and weightlifting.

Currently, I'm focused on improving my JavaScript and Rails skills so I can take my code to the next level and build more cool stuff. 

Feel free to connect with me for collaborations or just to chat about coding! Reach out to me at any of the following:
